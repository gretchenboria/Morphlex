  This file is intentionally left mostly blank.
  The actual application entry point is located at /packages/brain/index.html.
  A root-level index.html with an importmap was causing conflicts with the Vite development server,
  which was the direct cause of the blank screen rendering issue. This file is kept to satisfy
  platform requirements but must remain inert.
